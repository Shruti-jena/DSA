//Given an integer k and a string s, any character in the string can be selected and changed to any other uppercase English character. This operation can be performed up to k times. After completing these steps, return the length of the longest substring that contains the same letter.
// Input : s = "BAABAABBBAAA" , k = 2

// Output : 6

// Explanation : we can change the B present at index 0 , 3 (0 base indexing) to A.

// The new string is "AAAAAABBBAAA".

// The substring "AAAAAA" is the longest substring having same letter with length 6.
